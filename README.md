# The 30-Day Solana Developer Bootcamp

This bootcamp will equip Soll with the skills to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the Solana blockchain. Over the next 30 days, I'll be gaining a strong foundation in Solana's core concepts and client-side development.

## What I'll learn

- **Solana Fundamentals**: Deep dive into the architecture, functionalities, and advantages of Solana.
- **Building dApps**: Explore on-chain vs. off-chain functionalities, tokenization on Solana, and dApp design patterns.
- **Wallets and Transactions**: Understand how to interact with the blockchain using Solana wallets and write secure transactions.
- **Security Best Practices**: Learn essential security practices for blockchain development and dApp security considerations.

## Bootcamp Format

- Primarily virtual, with access to high-quality learning materials.
- **Two IRL Workshops**: Deep dive into specific topics with hands-on coding exercises and mentorship (location details to be announced).
- **Assignments and Participation**: Regularly test your knowledge and build your portfolio by submitting assignments to this GitHub repository.
